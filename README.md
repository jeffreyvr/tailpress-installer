# TailPress Installer

Installer to quickly get started with your next TailPress theme.

The installer has not been tested on Windows yet, but it should work. Let me know if you run into issues.

## Install WordPress

It is possible to install WordPress through the installer. You will be prompted with this option.

Note that this will setup WordPress, but you still need a local development enviroment for PHP and MySQL. If you use MacOS, try out [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/valet).

## Release notes

- Update version number in `bin/tailpress`.

## Thanks

This package is inspired by the [Laravel Installer](https://github.com/laravel/installer).
